# AdvantageTrack

**Note: AdvantageTrack is still under active development.**

AdvantageTrack is an attendance system by FRC 6328 built to combine a manual sign-in interface with automated tracking of student and mentor devices. Data storage and analysis are handled using Google Sheets, updated by the local Python server. The server runs a local web app for sign-ins & status, and it monitors the active devices on the local network using intermitent flood pings. Each team member can opt-in to the automatic tracking by registering their device's MAC address with the system.
